# Phase 1 Project Description

###Assessment of Low-Risk Aircraft for New Business Ventures

                      Project Overview
The project aims to evaluate the potential risks associated with aircrafts in order to guide the company's decision in expansion to aviation industry. By analysing the historical data on aircraft accidents, the project aims at identifying the lowest risk aircrafts that can be acquired for commercial and private operations.

<Project objectives>
 Assess the historical data on aircraft accidents and identify their safety profiles.
 Identify and recommend the aircrafts associated with lowest risk in regard to investment.
 present findings in an interactive dashboard to facilitate strategic business decisions.
 
 <Data Source>
The source of data for this project i th the national transportation safety Board (NTSB) data set. It comprises of the civil aviation  accidents and incidents from 1962 to 2023. the data set provides insights into frequency of aviation accidents over the years.

<Methodology>

1. Data Exploration
Investigation of data to understand the format, key variable and relevant factors that may influence aircraft safety.
 
2. Data Cleaning
Dealing with missing values through most suitable imputations/ removal, preprocessing of the data to ensure consistency

3. Data analysis
aggregation of data to analyze trends and patterns in aviation accidents by aircraft types. Posibbly the evaluation of factors that influence accident rates.
4. visualizations
development of interactive plots and dashboards to display insightful details and ellow for further data exploration.
5. compilations, recommendations and conclusions
make conclusions and recommendations for aircraft business ventures.
